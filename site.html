			1. you are not a clown. if you put a ghoul on your avu, spam zxczxczcxczcxzxc, pause after each kill for no reason and just poser - this does not mean that you are a ghoul, and you have no right to call yourself one
2. you must be poxyy. you are immoral, without moral qualities. they sent you to hell, they said that you were mediocre? do not disgrace, do not make excuses, do not answer, if you want to prove it - prove it in practice, destroy it in zxc, you did not tolerate it, you do not waste your time. did you promise to break things? beat them, stand in the amulet, answer for the words
		</article>
		<article id="idarticle">
			3. don't quit. you have 3k pts and you  that smurf? shut your mouth, this is your mmr, you play to win and do not take credit for what you have not achieved. Nobody owes you anything, and neither do you. if you break things because you didn't pick a support, you're a whiner, you're not a ghoul
4. every ghoul should at least know what zxc is, and even more so be able 
4. every ghoul should at least know what zxc is, and even more so be able to stand up for themselves there. if it is normal for men to exchange fists with another man, then it is also normal for a ghoul to answer or force him to answer for words in zxc. don't be a rag, you are stronger

			5. focus on the game, zitraks mod. your main goal is to win, you have to be able to give all mute, handle tilt and win unbeatable. Enemies should be afraid of ghouls, not laugh with whiner's rage bb
6. if you are worthy of being called a ghoul, then you a priori put yourself above the rest. if you are confident in yourself, then take the role, fpsh hero, your game is your rules, but do not ruin until they ruin you. double-mid pick? go to the forest in the sphere and drag solo, don't forget to pause when the fucker dies and tap on him, taunt them, but don't become a laughing stock, win all the games if the team didn't want or didn't deserve defeat, the choice is yours
